# g-waze â€” an app for viewing notifications on a map

Visit [g-waze](http://g-waze.appspot.com) for the live demo, and the [test page](http://test-notifications.staging.waze.com) for the Waze staging website.

### On viewing this source code

A few notes:
* This app uses AngularJS and App Engine, and builds off the [angular-seed project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).
  * To view the angularjs code, visit the app/ directory.
  * The server code (App Engine) aims to be just a proxy. To view the source, view main.py
* You'll need node.js to run the tests under the tests/ directory.

### Some tricky things with test-notifications!

There are a couple tricky things with the Waze test-notifications server!
* PUT requests need an application/x-www-form-urlencoded content header
* The test-notifications server will crash regularly, so handling error cases is very important.

### Running unit tests

Angular-seed recommend using [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io).

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files
